## Projects Overview 📚

### ES6 JavaScript Projects

#### [ES6_basic](./ES6_basic) 📝
An introduction to the fundamental concepts of ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), covering:
- Modern variable declarations (let, const)

#### [ES6_promise](./ES6_promise) 🔄
Comprehensive guide to handling asynchronous operations with Promises:

## Technologies Used 💻
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js
- Babel (for transpiling ES6+ code)
- ESLint (for code quality)
- Jest (for testing)

## Requirements ⚙️
Each project has its own specific requirements, but generally:
- All code is executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Node.js 12.x
- Code follows specific style guidelines enforced by ESLint
- All files end with a new line
- Functions and modules are properly exported
- Code is tested with Jest
